# Anaconda 2016 design adjustments

* Optimize Anaconda for the Workstation and Server split
  - Focus on Workstation first
* Simplify installations under typical conditions
    1. Preinstalled OS (Windows or OS X)
    2. Preinstalled OS â€” but with enough unallocated space
    3. Empty disk
    4. Previous Fedora install? (Ideally, upgrade path would be used)
* Realign Anaconda with newer design patterns shared with the desktop
